        <abstract>
            <para>VIS - &amp;#39;Specific Reference Freshwater Monitoring’ in Flanders, Belgium is a sample based dataset published by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). The original database is described in Brosens et al. 2015 (https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.475.8556). This dataset contains over 19,000  occurrences sampled between 2013 and 2023 from 45 locations per species in inland rivers, streams and canals in Flanders, Belgium. The dataset includes 4 target species (Cobitis taenia, Cottus perifretum, Lampetra planeri and Rhodeus amarus), as well as a number of non-target species. The data are retrieved from the Fish Information System (VIS), a database set up to monitor the status of fishes and their habitats in Flanders and are collected in support of the Water Framework Directive, the Habitat Directive, certain red lists, and biodiversity research. Additional information, such as measurements, absence information and abiotic data are available upon request. Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/inbo/data-publication/tree/master/datasets/vis-freshwater-monitoring-events</para><para>Length and weight measurement data of the individual fishes, absence information, occurrence data since 2013, as well as abiotic data of the sampling points (pH, temperature, etc.) are not included in the Darwin Core Archive and are available upon request.</para><para>To allow anyone to use this dataset, we have released the data to the public domain under a Creative Commons Zero waiver (http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

        <purpose><para>The Fish Information System or VIS (http://vis.milieuinfo.be) is a database created by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) which is used to monitor the status of fishes and their habitats in Flanders, Belgium and to calculate the biotic integrity (Karr 1981, Belpaire et al. 2000, Breine et al. 2004, 2007, 2010) of fish assemblages. It contains data regarding occurrences, individual morphometrics, stocks, pollutants, indices, and non-native fish species. Sampling has been going on since 1992, the database model was designed in 1994 (Verbiest et al. 1994), the first database developed in 1996 (Verbiest et al. 1996), and the consolidated database set up in 2001. VIS is used for supporting NATURA 2000, an ecological network of protected areas in Europe and to calculate the EQR (Ecological Quality Ratio) in the framework of the EU Water Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC). Further, the database provides updated information for Flemish Red Lists of fishes and lampreys (Verreycken et al. 2014) and on the distribution status of non-native and invasive fish species. The data are also crucial in fish stock management and for reporting on the status of the European eel stock as required by the Eel Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) N° 1100/2007). This dataset is a standardized extraction of all inland water species occurrences from VIS.</para></purpose>

                        <para>In 2011, we made a sample for the monitoring of bitterling, small mud creeper, pond sculpin and brook lamprey within the framework of the Habitats Directive. For each species, we used a sampling frame consisting of all watercourses (divided into the strata Flemish watercourses, 1st order watercourses and 2nd order watercourses) where the species was caught in the past. We first checked how many monitoring points could be expected for each species and within each stratum in the reference monitoring network for the Water Framework Directive. We then selected additional monitoring points from the sampling frame via random sampling so that we obtain at least 45 monitoring points per species and so that there is a representative distribution of monitoring points across the different strata. We call these additional measurement points the compaction measurement network.</para>

                <samplingDescription>
                    <para>Standardized sampling methods were used as described in Belpaire et al. (2000) and Van Thuyne &amp; Breine (2010) and are specified in the dataset as dwc:samplingProtocol. Per water body, the same method was used for each sampling event. The default method is electric fishing, but additional techniques such as gill nets, fykes, and seine netting (variable sizes) were used as well. Electric fishing was carried out using a 5 kW generator with an adjustable output voltage of 300–500 V and a pulse frequency of 480 Hz. The number of electric fishing devices and hand-held anodes used depends on the river width (Belpaire et al. 2000). In riverine environments, electric fishing was carried out on both riverbanks in upstream direction. All fishes were identified to species level, counted, and their length and weight was measured (measurement data available upon request). Since 2013, electric fishing was carried out until depletion.</para>
